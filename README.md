# LLM4HLS
Automated loop to rewrite C into synthesizable C for High-Level Synthesis 

*[C2HLSC.py](https://github.com/gohil-vasudev/DAC-2024-GREAT-Workshop/blob/main/HLS/C2HLSC.py)* shows an example of a complete script that uses an LLM in the loop using feedback from catapult to go from generic C to synthesizable C. [Paper C2HLSC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09233)   

The script requires Catapult HLS and OpenAI apis installed.
